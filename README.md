# Combination-of-LSTM-and-RNN
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are designed to process sequential data by retaining information through hidden states. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is an advanced type of RNN that overcomes the problem of forgetting long-term patterns. LSTM uses gates to control what information to keep or discard, making it ideal for time-series. and
